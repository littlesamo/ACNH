# Get purple windflower from seeds
## 1. white seed x white seed -> blue (25%)
* parents:
```
windflower, white, rryyWw (seed)
windflower, white, rryyWw (seed)
```
* Offsprings:
```
windflower, blue, rryyWW  rate: 0.25
windflower, white, rryyWw (seed) rate: 0.5
windflower, white, rryyww  rate: 0.25
```

## 2. red seed x blue -> red* (100%)
* parents:
```
windflower, red, RRyyww (seed)
windflower, blue, rryyWW
```
* Offsprings:
```
windflower, red*, RryyWw  rate: 1.0
```

## 3. red* x red* -> purple (6.25%)
* parents:
```
windflower, red*, RryyWw
windflower, red*, RryyWw
```
* Offsprings:
```
windflower, purple, RRyyWW  rate: 0.0625
windflower, red, RRyyWw  rate: 0.125
windflower, red, RRyyww (seed) rate: 0.0625
windflower, blue*, RryyWW  rate: 0.125
windflower, red, RryyWw  rate: 0.25
windflower, red, Rryyww  rate: 0.125
windflower, blue, rryyWW  rate: 0.0625
windflower, white, rryyWw (seed) rate: 0.125
windflower, white, rryyww  rate: 0.0625
```
#### Note: normal guide will stop here, but since we have the genetic analysis, you can do the following with the byproducts to increase the purple rate. 
* Testing blue and blue* - Breed with seed orange
    * blue -> always orange
    * blue* -> 50% orange 50% pink 
    * blue* is the one that produces pink

## We can increase rate using by-products from preivous step -> purple (12.5% - 25%) 
### 3-1. red* x blue* -> 12.5% purple
* parents:
```
windflower, red, RryyWw
windflower, blue, RryyWW
```
* Offsprings:
```
windflower, purple, RRyyWW  rate: 0.125
windflower, red**, RRyyWw  rate: 0.125
windflower, blue*, RryyWW  rate: 0.25
windflower, red*, RryyWw  rate: 0.25
windflower, blue, rryyWW  rate: 0.125
windflower, white, rryyWw (seed) rate: 0.125
```
#### Be sure to reuse the non-purple offsprings to previous step! 
* You will get only red* or red** (even better red) from above step; Breed back the offspring reds by placing them in red* and blue* cluster
* Test the new blue to find blue* and blue that can be used in previous steps
* Testing red* and red** - Breed with seed orange. 
    * red* x orange -> 50% orange, 50% pink
    * red** x orange -> always pink
    * red** is the one that doesn't produce orange 
* If you tested all the blues and know which ones are blue*. You can bree them seperately. blue* x blue* -> purple (25%)
